+ Product Page Description (About this extension)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Quickly removing annoying or unnecessary elements from a page is pretty much the basic idea for this extension. Additional features allow for various manipulation of web elements.

Pretty similar to the 'Aardvark' and 'Element Hiding Helper for Adblock Plus' extensions.

Start a Lizard session using the toolbar button or the <i>Ctrl+Shift+L</i> shortcut. The help box that will popup will provide you with all the information you'll need. It can also redirect you to the Options page (bottom link) for some tinkering.

◼ <b>REMEMBER PAGE ALTERATIONS</b>
As of Lizard v1.20 changes to elements (removed, color, etc.) will be remembered and applied automatically when you revisit the web page.

This experimental feature can be activated from the extension Options page and is only available for Firefox version 64.0 and above.

The feature also includes a dashboard to manage the alteration rules and can be accessed from the Options page or from the toolbar button context menu.
